MRI (for Matz's Ruby Interpreter).

was the reference implementation of the Ruby programming language named after Ruby creator Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz"). Until the specification of the Ruby language in 2011, the MRI implementation was considered the de facto reference, especially since an independent attempt to create the specification (RubySpec) had failed. Starting with Ruby 1.9, and continuing with Ruby 2.x and above, the official Ruby interpreter has been YARV.

大神的github地址在这里[4]，最高星级的项目是Streem，是正在设计的一个新的脚本语言，网页上写着“Streem is a stream based concurrent scripting language. It is based on a programming model similar to the shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang, and other functional programming languages.”。除了这个项目之外，另一个星级较高的项目是MRuby，是他自己实现的一个轻量级的Ruby，但是更新日期停在了8年之前，除此之外，其他项目的星级都是个位数。当然matz也参加了Ruby项目[5]，从贡献者提交的信息来看，matz提交的代码大多在2010年以前，这之后就很少提交了，反而是其他几个人贡献的比较多。


Streem is a stream based concurrent scripting language. It is based on a programming model similar to the shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang, and other functional programming languages.

Note: Streem is still in the design stage. It's not working yet. Stay tuned.
